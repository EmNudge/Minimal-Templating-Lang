    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    <p>This is a minimal templating language that should never ever be used by anyone. It was a test to see if I could make a mini-templating language with just node. It works similarly to a stripped down version of things like pug. It only has a very basic partials system.</p>
    <p>Will it be expanded in the future? Possibly, but don't bet on it. It was just a way to occupy some free time I had on an off day.</p>
