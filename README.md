# Minimal-Templating-Lang
The most minimal of templating languages

<br/>

This is a minimal templating language that should never ever be used by anyone. It was a test to see if I could make a mini-templating language with just node. It works similarly to a stripped down version of things like pug. It only has a very basic partials system.

Will it be expanded in the future? Possibly, but don't bet on it. It was just a way to occupy some free time I had on an off day.

The one this this showed me is that my code is abhorrently messy when doing complex string mutilation. Regex alone is clearly not enough to create somewhat readable text transformation. I may need to dig into parsing frameworks.
